For a possible method to have Jupyter use Julia:

1. Julia must be installed

I had to tell git to use https instead of git:// for some reason by running:
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://


**** I don't know if this changes the overall git behavior.  This was necessary for
Mac OS X Yosemitte with a Homebrew install of julia.

Then:
2. In Julia ($julia):
  Pkg.add("IJulia")




  Now, restart notebook:

  $ipython notebook

  This should have a dropdown option to open a new notebook using Julia.
